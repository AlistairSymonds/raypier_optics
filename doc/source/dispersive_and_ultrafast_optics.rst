Dispersive and Ultrafast Optics
===============================

Utrafast optical systems can be modelled using either a BroadbandRaySource or BroadbandGaussletSource.
These create a collection of rays with wavelengths spanning some range, such that the different ray-paths according to wavelength can be explored.
