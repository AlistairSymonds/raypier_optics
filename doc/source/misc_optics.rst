Other Optic Types
=================

For optic-types which don't fit the General Optics framework, we have support for each type 
in their own submodules. There are also a few submodules for optics which predate the General Optics
framework.

Diffraction Gratings

I intend to migrate the DiffractionGratingFace to the GeneralOptic framework.

Off-axis ellisoids
